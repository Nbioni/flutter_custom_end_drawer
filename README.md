I'm developing a dashboard that clicking profile on the header will open an endDrawer that applies a background shadow only to the application body, I did this by calling the showBodyScrim event that allows me to pass whether we should present the background shading and its opacity.

I wish I could choose the background color of my bodyScrim. That is, I would like to be able to somehow set the value of "_bodyScrimColor".

My questions:

Is there a better way to open an endDrawer without applying shading to my AppBar and being able to pick the drop shadow color?
If not, how could I choose the color of my bodyScrimColor?
